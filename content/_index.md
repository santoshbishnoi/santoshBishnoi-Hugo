Hi! I am Santosh, and this is my personel homepage.

On paper I'm a 3rd year CS Undergrad a PES University, but really I am a trader, actively trading in Equity and derivatives
segment and a Quantative Analyst ( it's more like looking at sky and connecting the dots to identify patterns.)

Lately, I've been wanting to start writing and share my findings/thoughts about capital markets, personel finance and much more. So here I am giving words to my thoughts.
